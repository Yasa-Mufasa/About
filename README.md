# About Me
![self](/Images/self1.jpg)

I am a master’s student at Bellevue University studying Data Science. I currently live in the Salt Lake Valley. I work in the Finance Industry as a Senior Analyst, specializing in Student Loans. I enjoy the challenge of working within a set of regulations and ensuring our customers are taken care of in the best way possible.

Prior to working in Finance, I worked in construction as an inspector. I love the outdoors, but there is value in a desk job.

When I’m not working or studying, I’m outside in the mountains taking pictures, either with my cell phone camera or Cannon DSLR camera. I particularly like taking pictures during sunset during the different times of the year. Two of my favorite pictures I’ve taken are on top of Angel’s Landing in Zion National Park and a picture through the trees on the path up Ensign Peak in the Salt Lake Valley.
